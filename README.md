# News Summary challenge

Create an app that summarises the news.

The app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.


### Technologies

Write a single page web app in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML without using Ruby, backend JavaScript, libraries or frameworks.

I'll use a static web server to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and I'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.
